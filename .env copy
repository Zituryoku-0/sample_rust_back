# DO NOT put real secrets in this file. Instead:
#   1. Copy this file to ".env" (or another local-only env file).
#   2. Adjust the values as needed for your environment.
#   3. Ensure your real ".env" is listed in .gitignore so it is not committed.
#
# The values below are safe, non-sensitive defaults for local use.

# Application port
# PORT=3000
